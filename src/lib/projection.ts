/**
 * d3-geo projection fitted to a crop framing the marked location and the
 * stretch of the path-of-totality that threads past it (PLAN.md §7).
 *
 * The crop is a window CENTERED ON THE LOCATION with a configurable degree
 * span — not the whole central line. The full line spans thousands of km
 * (the 2024 path covers ~130° of longitude); framing all of it shows half the
 * globe and reduces the path to a hairline. Centring on the location keeps the
 * geography legible and the path reading as the subject. Pan/zoom of this
 * window is what the generator randomizes later (§2: path crop/scale/position).
 *
 * v1 uses geoMercator — conformal, and with a location-centered window it never
 * approaches the pole, so Mercator's polar blow-up is a non-issue.
